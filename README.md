# digit-recognition-cnn
A convolutional neural network implementation in C++ which aims to recognise digits from MNIST dataset.

This repo also includes a generic library of neural networks that can be extended by implementing child classes to the abstract layer class. This project uses ygzlinalg linear algebra library.
